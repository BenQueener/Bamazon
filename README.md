# Bamazon
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront made with Javascript, Node.js, and MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. When the customer makes a valid order the program will calculate the total cost of the order.  After waiting for a couple of seconds the program will show the inventory again with updated quantity of the item sold to reflect the depletion of the stocked items.

## LIRI has two customer functions
* select the item to buy
* select the quantitiy of that item you want to buy.

A picture of the program running is in the git repository.
